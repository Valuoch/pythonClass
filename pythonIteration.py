#ITERATION (two types; for and while)
#1.For
# Checks for acondition and gives the output utill the condition is false
#anything put before 'for' becomes a variable
# Example

# list = [1,2,3,4,5]
# print(list[0])
# print(list[1])
# print(list[2])
# print(list[3])
# print(list[4])

# name = "Valentine"
# list =['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
# counter = 1
# for each in list:
#   print("Element:", counter , "=", name)
#   counter+=1

# marks = [50, 70, 80, 88, 90]
# totalmarks = 0
# for each in marks:
#     totalmarks=totalmarks + each
# print(totalmarks)
   # print(each)

# print(sum(marks))


#2.while- used while knowing a definate value; used when checking a range of value or true or false

# while test expression:
#     block of code to be executed (can only be executed if test expression is tru)
# while True:
#     print('Valentine')
# i = 1
# while i < len(range(0,10)):
#     print(i)
#     i = i + 1

# Write a program that prints your name 100 times.
